The python code for the tortuosity measurement is given in the file _tort_ 
The results for each sample's porosity and tortuosity are given in _tortuosity_results_x_.txt_

Permeability was calculated using Stokes Flow and Darcy Law
The code is given in _permeability_calculator_

The results are shown below:
